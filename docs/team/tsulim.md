### Project: StaffConnect

StaffConnect offers convenience and peace of mind to a struggling student with memory recollection issues. This product allows users to easily identify and connect with educators by providing visual cues alongside contact details, supported by a quick and easy filter system. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a `fav` and `unfav` command that allows the user to set contacts as Favourite, prioritizing them at the top of the list.
  * What it does: allows the user to set selected contact as favourite. Preceding `unfav` commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view contacts that they prioritize at the top without the need to search below, bringing them more conveniences.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tsulim&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2024-02-23&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=tsulim&tabRepo=AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
